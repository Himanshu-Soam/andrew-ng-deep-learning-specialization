### 1. What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?

- [ ] AI is powering personal devices in our homes and offices, similar to electricity.  
- [ ] Through the “smart grid”, AI is delivering a new wave of electricity.  
- [ ] AI runs on computers and is thus powered by electricity, but it is letting computers do things not possible before.  
- [x] Similar to electricity beginning over a century ago, AI is now transforming multiple industries.

> **Note:** Andrew Ng used this analogy to highlight how AI, like electricity, is becoming a general-purpose technology with wide-reaching impact.

### 2. Which of the following are key reasons why deep learning has recently become so successful? *(Select two)*

- [x] Access to significantly more computational power (e.g., GPUs).  
- [ ] Neural networks are a brand new technology.  
- [x] Availability of large amounts of data.  
- [ ] Deep learning is limited to only a few niche applications.

---

### 3. Regarding the iteration process in ML development, which statements are correct? *(Select all that apply)*

- [x] Being able to rapidly experiment with new ideas accelerates deep learning development.  
- [x] Faster compute resources reduce the time it takes to test and improve models.  
- [ ] Training on a larger dataset is always faster than using a smaller one.  
- [x] Advances in deep learning algorithms help reduce training time, even without hardware changes.

> **Note:** While larger datasets can improve performance, they usually require more time to train on.

### 4. An experienced deep learning practitioner can usually train an optimal model on the first attempt without needing to iterate. True or False?

- [ ] True  
- [x] False

> **Note:** Even experienced engineers typically go through several iterations to optimize model performance.

### 5. Which of the following graphs best represents the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function?

🔗 Refer to this [ReLU Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) for visual reference.

### 6. Images used for cat recognition are considered "structured" data. True or False?

- [ ] True  
- [x] False

> **Note:** Images are considered **unstructured data**, despite being represented as arrays in code.

---

### 7. A demographic dataset (e.g., population, GDP per capita) is considered unstructured data. True or False?

- [ ] True  
- [x] False

> **Note:** Such datasets are examples of **structured data**—well-organized in rows and columns.

---

### 8. Why are RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) useful for tasks like machine translation? *(Select all that apply)*

- [x] RNNs can be trained using supervised learning methods.  
- [ ] They are strictly more powerful than CNNs.  
- [x] They are effective for sequence data such as language.  
- [ ] RNNs model the iterative process of designing machine learning systems.

### 9. In the performance vs. data size plot shown in lecture, what do the axes represent?

- **x-axis**: Amount of data  
- **y-axis**: Performance of the algorithm

---

### 10. Based on the above performance vs. data size plot, which statements are true? *(Select all that apply)*

- [x] Increasing the training data size often improves performance and rarely hurts it.  
- [x] Increasing the neural network size generally helps improve performance.  
- [ ] Reducing the training data size tends to improve performance.  
- [ ] Reducing the neural network size often improves performance.
